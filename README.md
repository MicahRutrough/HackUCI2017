The user has the ability to customize the extension by putting in their name and their home address. The name allows us to be able to talk to the user by their name and the address allows us to record how far we are from home for some of our features.

We also created a page where we could graph the information that we have recorded. We were able to graph using time as the x axis and then we used other things for the y axis. Some of the things we used for the x axis were the mood, air polution and the distance between the current location to the location of home.
